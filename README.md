# Assessment-Project-Broadcast
A mini frontend challenge during a hiring process

This is a static SPA forged from their requirement:

> I would like to validate if an entered credit card number is a valid credit card number using the [Luhn algorithm](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm).
>
> A user should be able to enter a credit card number into a React based UI where the validation logic is a node powered express service.
